# Circle Nesting Nullset Visualizer

This Python script generates SVG visualizations of nested circles. It showcases circles placed inside one another, creating intricate patterns and arrangements. The script utilizes mathematical calculations to position circles accurately.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script, and it will generate an SVG file called `output.svg`.
3. Open the `output.svg` file in a compatible viewer to see the visualization.

## Visualization Details

The script defines circles with a radius and a list of other circles placed inside them. It uses recursive logic to generate these nested structures. Each circle is positioned in relation to its parent circle.

## Customization

You can adjust the `zoom` variable to control the scale of the visualization. The larger the `zoom`, the larger the circles will appear in the SVG output.

## Sample Output

The script generates intricate patterns of nested circles. You can find an example visualization in the `output.svg` file included in this repository.
